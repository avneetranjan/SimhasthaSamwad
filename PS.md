Problem Statement:

Small businesses in UAE retail and F&B face two major issues: inaccurate demand forecasting and invisible inventory losses. These problems silently shrink margins, stress staff, and hurt customer experience.



Most SMEs rely on manual logs, standard PoS systems, or gut feeling. In a tourism-driven, event-heavy, and seasonally dynamic market like the UAE, this approach fails.



Key pain points:


· Unpredictable demand swings caused by weather, global events (e.g., COP28, Ramadan), school holidays, and tourism campaigns.



· Micro-seasonal variations (e.g., Ramadan evening rush, long weekend slumps).



· Weak data feedback loops—no real-time integration of traffic, delivery, or product movement.



Impact:


· Over-ordering perishables that expire before sale.



· Understocking during surges, leading to lost sales.



· Silent shrinkage (mislabeling, waste, untracked staff use) noticed only at month-end.



Despite being digitally active on the front end (Instagram, WhatsApp, Talabat), most SMEs lack back-end intelligence that ties together demand forecasts, product movement, and shrinkage.



Challenge:


How can AI help UAE SMEs predict demand, optimize inventory, and reduce shrinkage—using tools simple enough for small teams with limited IT and fragmented data (PoS, Excel, WhatsApp orders)?



Evaluation Rubric:


Relevance to UAE SME environment (20%) – Addresses seasonality, tourism, and bilingual operations.



AI/ML innovation (25%) – Forecasting, anomaly detection, or dynamic inventory recommendations.



Integration simplicity (20%) – Works with PoS, Excel, WhatsApp, or basic cloud tools.



Commercial impact (25%) – Clear ROI through margin improvement and waste reduction.



Scalability (10%) – Usable across groceries, cafes, salons, and other SMEs
